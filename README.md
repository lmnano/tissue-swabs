# Tissue swabs

## Intro

This is a project about comparing tissue and skin swab DNA samples from Proteus.

## Scripts

In the R script scripts/tissue_swab_result_analysisFINAL.R is code used for producing certain tables and figures in the corresponding paper.

The first part of the script loads data and produces a table (table S2) with proportions of reads mapped with different alogirhms and in different combinations, and two figures with proportions of matches.

The second part produces pie charts used for making figure 5, with proportions of different taxa in exogenous DNA, and data for a table (table S5) with top ten most commonly found species in the exogenous DNA with Blast.
